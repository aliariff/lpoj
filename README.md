This is legacy code, i help to develop it when i was in 3rd semester during my bachelor degree (2012). Sorry if the code is kind of ugly :D

This is online judge application for competitive programming. Developed use PHP (CodeIgniter), and compile thing handle by Python scripts. For now its supports C/C++ Language only. Hope it will support other language like Java, Python, Ruby, etc in near future.

   You can googling how to install it.
